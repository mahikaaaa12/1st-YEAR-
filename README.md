Welcome to my GitHub repository, where I document and share all the C++ programs and code that I am learning during my first year of B.Tech in Computer Science Engineering (CSE) with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AIML).

Overview:
This repository contains the C++ programs and assignments I work on throughout my first-year coursework. It includes basic and intermediate-level C++ concepts that are essential for building a strong foundation in programming.

Repository Structure
The repository is structured into folders based on different topics or assignments covered during my course. Each folder may contain:
- Source code (.cpp files): The actual C++ code files.
- Assignments: Any specific assignments or problem statements.
- ReadMe: Explanation and instructions, if necessary, for running the code.

Topics Covered
As I progress through my first year, I'll update this section to reflect the key topics that are covered in the code files:
1. Basic Syntax: Input/output, variables, and data types
2. Control Structures: Conditional statements (if, else) and loops (for, while)
3. Functions and Recursion
4. Arrays and Strings
5. Pointers and References
6. Object-Oriented Programming: Classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism
7. File Handling
8. Data Structures: Stacks, queues, linked lists, etc.
9. **Algorithms**: Sorting, searching, etc.

How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/mahikaaaa12/1st-year.git
2. Navigate to the relevant folder to find the C++ program you're interested in.
3. Compile and run the program using any C++ compiler. For example, if you are using `g++`:
   g++ filename.cpp -o outputfile
   ./outputfile
   
Prerequisites
- A C++ compiler (such as `g++` or any IDE like Code::Blocks, Visual Studio, etc.)
- Basic understanding of C++ syntax and programming concepts.

Contributing
This repository is primarily for personal learning, but if you find an issue or have suggestions, please open a pull request or issue. Contributions that help improve the quality of the code or offer optimizations are always welcome!
